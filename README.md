## FRAMEWORK USED ##

Ruby

## HOW TO USE ##
From the command line, enter:
```script
ruby ./boris-bikes/boris-bikes.rb

## STEPS ##
1. The first step of this exercise was to create this directory, initialise a git, create this readme and push to github.
2. Next we translated some user stories into functional representations over here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xjil_MCMeRIaGoWcDQp8bMnEl_8EWXU6wqdAhFShFig/edit?usp=sharing
